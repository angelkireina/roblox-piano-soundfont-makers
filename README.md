# roblox-piano-soundfont-makers
FL Studio 20 Manageable files for making Roblox piano compatible soundfonts.
All the files were made in FL Studio 20 and use respective FL Studio 20 default-included plugins (Fruity Parametric EQ 2 & Fruit Reeverb 2).

To download the FLPs, Please go to the "Releases" inside this directory.

There are 6 or 88 respective Patterns listed in Playlist (This changes between normal "Soundfont Maker - Default" and "Soundfont Maker - 88 Key Format").
For exporting the files without having to go over every single pattern, Use FILE > Export > All playlist tracks...

These will be exported as ".wav" and you select the quality, I do recommend after exporting, using an external application for changing the format (Personally, I use "Audacity" for a faster and more effective convertion.)
